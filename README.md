# project-vi

Project Vi is a simple Cookie Clicker indie game based off of Vi from League of Legend's Netflix Show Arcane.
In this repository lies the C# code pasted into Unity to create the game; however, it does not contain the pixel art nor music tracks embedded into the game.
Pixel Art all created by Casey Tran aside from the transistioning night and day patterns.
